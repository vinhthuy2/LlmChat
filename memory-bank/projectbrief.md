3. Maintain chat session state
4. Integrate with Ollama for LLM capabilities
5. Enable cross-origin requests for web client integration
6. Implement persistent session storage
7. Provide structured logging
8. Support real-time streaming of LLM responses
9. Implement comprehensive test coverage
10. Support test-driven development
11. Enable English learning through role-play
12. Maintain conversation history
13. Support deferred message processing
14. Implement streaming error handling
