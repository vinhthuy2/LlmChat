2. Support streaming responses using Server-Sent Events
3. Maintain chat session state
4. Integrate with Ollama for LLM capabilities
5. Enable cross-origin requests for web client integration
6. Implement persistent session storage
7. Provide structured logging
8. Support real-time streaming of LLM responses
9. Implement comprehensive test coverage
10. Support test-driven development

## Technical Goals
1. Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Efficient chat session management
3. Real-time response streaming
4. Scalable and maintainable codebase
5. Comprehensive API documentation
6. Robust error handling
7. Secure API endpoints
8. Performance optimization
9. High test coverage
10. Maintainable test suite

## Success Criteria
