# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Chat session management implementation
- Repository pattern implementation
- Logging integration
- Database persistence
- API endpoint development
- Ollama integration for LLM capabilities

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented ChatSessionRepository
2. Added IChatSessionRepository interface
3. Implemented ChatSessionStore
4. Added IChatSessionStore interface
5. Added ChatSessionService
6. Added IChatSessionService interface
7. Implemented structured logging with Serilog
8. Added logging service and configuration
9. Integrated logging into repositories and services
10. Set up SQLite persistence
11. Added OllamaAgent for LLM integration
12. Implemented streaming response support
13. Added comprehensive test coverage for all components

## Active Decisions
1. Using Repository pattern for data access
2. Using SQLite for simplicity and portability
3. Interface-based design for loose coupling
4. Structured logging with Serilog
5. Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
6. Using Ollama for LLM capabilities
7. Supporting both synchronous and streaming responses

## Current Considerations
1. Extending logging to other components
2. Adding performance metrics
3. Testing strategy
4. Configuration management
5. Performance optimization
6. Error handling improvements
7. Security implementation
8. Rate limiting implementation

## Next Steps
1. Add logging to remaining components
2. Add performance metrics logging
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Move configuration to appsettings
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Implement authentication
7. Implement rate limiting
8. Add error handling middleware
9. Add API documentation
10. Implement security features

## Known Issues
1. Hardcoded database connection
2. Limited error handling
3. Missing test coverage for some components
4. Configuration needs improvement
5. Security features pending
6. Rate limiting not implemented
7. API documentation incomplete
