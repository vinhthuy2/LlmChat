5. Added ChatSessionService
6. Added IChatSessionService interface
7. Implemented structured logging with Serilog
8. Added logging service and configuration
9. Integrated logging into repositories and services
10. Set up SQLite persistence
11. Added OllamaAgent for LLM integration
12. Implemented streaming response support
13. Added comprehensive test coverage for all components
14. Added unit tests for LoggingService
15. Added unit tests for ChatSessionService
16. Added unit tests for ChatSessionStore
17. Added English learning buddy system prompt

## Active Decisions
1. Using Repository pattern for data access
2. Using SQLite for simplicity and portability
3. Interface-based design for loose coupling
4. Structured logging with Serilog
5. Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
6. Using Ollama for LLM capabilities
7. Supporting both synchronous and streaming responses
8. Using MSTest and NSubstitute for testing
9. Using in-memory dictionaries for conversation history
10. Implementing deferred message processing for streaming

## Current Considerations
1. Extending logging to other components
2. Adding performance metrics
3. Testing strategy
4. Configuration management
5. Performance optimization
6. Error handling improvements
7. Security implementation
8. Rate limiting implementation
9. Conversation history persistence strategy
10. Message streaming optimization

## Next Steps
1. Add logging to remaining components
2. Add performance metrics logging
3. Add unit and integration tests
4. Move configuration to appsettings
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Implement authentication
7. Implement rate limiting
8. Add error handling middleware
9. Add API documentation
10. Implement security features
11. Optimize conversation history storage
12. Enhance streaming response handling

## Known Issues
1. Hardcoded database connection
2. Limited error handling
3. Missing test coverage for some components
4. Configuration needs improvement
5. Security features pending
6. Rate limiting not implemented
7. API documentation incomplete
8. Conversation history persistence needs optimization
9. Streaming response handling could be improved
