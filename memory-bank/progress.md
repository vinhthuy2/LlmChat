2. Missing test coverage for some components
3. Configuration needs work
4. Security features pending
5. Logging not fully integrated
6. Rate limiting not implemented
7. API documentation incomplete
8. Performance metrics missing
9. Conversation history persistence needs optimization
10. Streaming response handling could be improved
